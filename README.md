# George

This is a simple script to include to autofill forms with one click! It is configurable to easily use the values you want or create random input data!
Still in development, al lot will be added soon:
- Name generator
- Random stories
- Easier config management
- More form element support
- Better random words

All credit to Milas, my co-worker, who first introduced me to the idea (and simple implentation) of George.
